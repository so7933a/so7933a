I am a marketing and communications professional with over a decade of experience in branding, graphic design, programming, and strategic communications. I’ve worked with major media companies like NPR, NBC Universal, Disney, and CBS, as well as national and local non-profits, including The Los Angeles LGBT Center, The People Concern, Victory Fund, the National LGBTQ Task Force, LULAC, and the Human Rights Campaign. My expertise spans integrated marketing, digital strategy, and community engagement.

In addition to my marketing background, I’m a skilled software engineer with over three years of contract work experience. I’ve worked on web and app development, handling both front-end and back-end projects. I’m proficient in Python, Java, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, which allows me to develop dynamic and scalable digital solutions. By combining my creative and technical expertise, I bring innovative approaches to media, technology, and branding.

I studied at American University in Washington, D.C., where I further developed my passion for media, technology, and advocacy. Outside of work, I enjoy hiking and running, which keep me active and connected to nature. My hobbies include reading and astronomy, as I love exploring new ideas and learning about the universe.🔭🪐💻🎮
